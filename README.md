# Password Attacks (Presentation): 
This served as an introductory presentation, laying the theoretical groundwork for various password attack techniques, including their principles and common scenarios.
# Password Cracking Tools (Presentation):
This presentation detailed a range of tools used in password cracking, explaining their functionalities and how they are employed in different attack vectors. Basis for the other labs.

#Lab - Passwords: 
This foundational lab likely covered basic password concepts, such as password policies, common weaknesses, and perhaps initial steps in password security awareness.
#Lab - Brute Force Offline: 
In this lab, I gained practical experience in performing offline brute-force attacks, understanding how attackers systematically try every possible character combination to guess passwords.
# Lab Dictionary Attack: 
This lab focused on executing dictionary attacks, demonstrating how attackers use pre-compiled lists of common words and phrases to crack passwords more efficiently.
# Lab Rainbow Table:
 This lab provided hands-on experience with rainbow tables, illustrating their use in rapidly cracking hashed passwords without needing to recompute hashes for every guess.
# Prep for NSA Dir. Visit
During the school year, an NSA director Ms. Ashley Greeley and a Nova Southeastern University professor Dr. Yair Levy visited our school to discuss the NSA's role in protecting personal information. They also covered scholarship opportunities, expectations for an NSA role, and the unique challenges of cybersecurity careers within the government.\
# Prep for Potential Client Visit (Broward Health)
I participated in an assignment that involved visiting Broward Health headquarters. During this visit, our team devised questions to pose to key executives, and I had the opportunity to directly engage with and ask questions of the CEO. I even had the chance to be interviewed by Mr. Deshaun Kennedy where we practiced an interview session in a professional environment.
# Teams Meeting with Ms. Passmore
I participated in an insightful meeting with Ms. Passmore, focusing on the field of digital forensics. During this session, we engaged in a valuable Q&A, allowing us to delve deeper into the subject. This unique learning opportunity was made possible by our teacher, Mr. Abrantes, who arranged it for us after completing a specialized course in digital forensics.

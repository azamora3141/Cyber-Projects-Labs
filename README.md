# Password Attacks (Presentation): 
This served as an introductory presentation, laying the theoretical groundwork for various password attack techniques, including their principles and common scenarios.
# Password Cracking Tools (Presentation):
This presentation detailed a range of tools used in password cracking, explaining their functionalities and how they are employed in different attack vectors. Basis for the other labs.

#Lab - Passwords: 
This foundational lab likely covered basic password concepts, such as password policies, common weaknesses, and perhaps initial steps in password security awareness.
#Lab - Brute Force Offline: 
In this lab, I gained practical experience in performing offline brute-force attacks, understanding how attackers systematically try every possible character combination to guess passwords.
# Lab Dictionary Attack: 
This lab focused on executing dictionary attacks, demonstrating how attackers use pre-compiled lists of common words and phrases to crack passwords more efficiently.
# Lab Rainbow Table:
 This lab provided hands-on experience with rainbow tables, illustrating their use in rapidly cracking hashed passwords without needing to recompute hashes for every guess.
